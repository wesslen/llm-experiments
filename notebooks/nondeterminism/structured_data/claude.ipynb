        "## Experiment Overview\n",
        "* Tests Claude's (`claude-3-sonnet-20240229`) output consistency with structured JSON responses\n",
        "* Uses three different prompt types:\n",
        "  - Exercise benefits (descriptive/analytical)\n",
        "  - Random numbers (explicit randomness)\n",
        "  - Major cities (factual)\n",
        "* Runs 20 iterations per prompt\n",
        "* Measures variation using entropy scores and unique response counts\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "* Exercise benefits: Expected moderate variation (entropy ~1.0-1.5)\n",
        "* Random numbers: Expected high variation (entropy ~2.0-2.5)\n",
        "* City names: Expected low variation (entropy ~0.5-1.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results Analysis\n",
        "* Exercise Benefits\n",
        "  - Shows increasing entropy across fields (0.708 → 1.148 → 2.346)\n",
        "  - benefit1: Strong preference for \"Improved cardiovascular health\" (16/20 responses)\n",
        "  - benefit3: Highest variation with 12 unique phrasings for mental health benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "* Random Numbers\n",
        "  - Less random than expected\n",
        "  - num1: Strong preference for \"42\" (15/20 responses)\n",
        "  - num2 & num3: Moderate variation (~9 unique values each)\n",
        "  - Shows clustering around certain numbers rather than uniform distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cities\n",
        "  - Most consistent of all prompts\n",
        "  - Strong preferences: Tokyo (city1), New York/New York City (city2), London (city3)\n",
        "  - Shows pattern-matching behavior rather than true randomness\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Finding: Claude shows significantly less non-determinism than hypothesized, suggesting strong underlying preferences even when asked for random or varied responses."
