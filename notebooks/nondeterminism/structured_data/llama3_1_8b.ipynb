        "## Experiment Overview\n",
        "* Tests Llama 3.1 8B Instruct's output consistency with structured JSON responses\n",
        "* Uses three different prompt types:\n",
        "  - Exercise benefits (descriptive/analytical)\n",
        "  - Random numbers (explicit randomness)\n",
        "  - Major cities (factual)\n",
        "* Runs 20 iterations per prompt\n",
        "* Measures variation using entropy scores and unique response counts\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "* Exercise benefits: Expected moderate variation (entropy ~1.0-1.5)\n",
        "* Random numbers: Expected high variation (entropy ~2.0-2.5)\n",
        "* City names: Expected low variation (entropy ~0.5-1.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results Analysis\n",
        "* Exercise Benefits\n",
        "  - Shows consistently high entropy across all fields (2.831, 2.926, 2.926)\n",
        "  - Extremely high variation with 18-19 unique responses per field\n",
        "  - Strong tendency to elaborate and expand on basic concepts\n",
        "  - Shows significant rephrasing of similar concepts rather than entirely different ideas\n",
        "\n",
        "* Random Numbers\n",
        "  - Shows moderate clustering behavior\n",
        "  - num1: Strong preference for \"53\" (12/20 responses)\n",
        "  - num2: Strong preference for \"91\" (14/20 responses)\n",
        "  - num3: Preference for \"14\" (10/20 responses)\n",
        "  - Lower entropy than exercise responses (1.175, 0.984, 1.402)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cities\n",
        "  - Shows moderate consistency with some variation\n",
        "  - city1: Strong preference for \"New York/New York City\" (16/20 combined)\n",
        "  - city2: More distributed between London, Tokyo, and New York\n",
        "  - city3: Balanced between London and Tokyo\n",
        "  - Entropy increases from city1 to city2 (0.886 → 1.479)\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Finding: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct shows significantly higher non-determinism in descriptive tasks compared to the original hypothesis, but maintains more predictable patterns in factual and numerical responses. This suggests the model has stronger anchoring to factual knowledge but more flexibility in generating descriptive content."
