        "## Experiment Overview\n",
        "* Tests Llama 3.1 8B Instruct's output consistency with structured JSON responses\n",
        "* This run uses Pydantic with LangChain for structured data generation.\n",
        "* Uses three different prompt types:\n",
        "  - Exercise benefits (descriptive/analytical)\n",
        "  - Random numbers (explicit randomness)\n",
        "  - Major cities (factual)\n",
        "* Runs 20 iterations per prompt\n",
        "* Measures variation using entropy scores and unique response counts\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "* Exercise benefits: Expected moderate variation (entropy ~1.0-1.5)\n",
        "* Random numbers: Expected high variation (entropy ~2.0-2.5)\n",
        "* City names: Expected low variation (entropy ~0.5-1.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results Analysis\n",
        "* Exercise Benefits\n",
        "  - Moderate success rate (55%) with 11 successful responses out of 20 attempts\n",
        "  - Consistently high entropy across all fields (2.398 for all three)\n",
        "  - Each field shows 11 unique variations, indicating balanced diversity\n",
        "  - Responses maintain high quality and coherence despite variations\n",
        "  - Benefits show clear thematic consistency while varying in specific wording\n",
        "\n",
        "* Random Numbers\n",
        "  - Perfect success rate (100%) with all 20 attempts successful\n",
        "  - Moderate to high entropy across fields (2.346, 1.692, 2.042)\n",
        "  - Shows some clustering around specific numbers:\n",
        "    - num1: \"14\" appears most frequently (4 times)\n",
        "    - num2: \"91\" appears most frequently (8 times)\n",
        "    - num3: \"13\" and \"28\" tied for most frequent (4 times each)\n",
        "  - Demonstrates successful uniqueness validation between numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cities\n",
        "  - High success rate (95%) with 19 successful responses\n",
        "  - Very low entropy (0.000, 0.206, 0.206) indicating high consistency\n",
        "  - Strong preferences for specific cities:\n",
        "    - Tokyo consistently as city1 (100% of successful responses)\n",
        "    - Delhi dominated city2 (18/19 responses)\n",
        "    - Shanghai dominated city3 (18/19 responses)\n",
        "  - Shows deterministic behavior despite temperature=1.0 setting\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Finding: The model shows distinct patterns of variation based on task type:\n",
        "- High variation for descriptive content (exercise benefits)\n",
        "- Moderate variation for numerical choices (random numbers)\n",
        "- High consistency for factual knowledge (cities), suggesting strong priors for major city rankings\n",
        "\n",
        "This improved version with fixed validation shows more clearly how the model handles different types of structured outputs, with variation levels appropriate to the content type."
