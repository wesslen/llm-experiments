        "* This run uses Pydantic with LangChain for structured data generation.\n",
        "* Uses three different prompt types:\n",
        "  - Exercise benefits (descriptive/analytical)\n",
        "  - Random numbers (explicit randomness)\n",
        "  - Major cities (factual)\n",
        "* Runs 20 iterations per prompt\n",
        "* Measures variation using entropy scores and unique response counts\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "* Exercise benefits: Expected moderate variation (entropy ~1.0-1.5)\n",
        "* Random numbers: Expected high variation (entropy ~2.0-2.5)\n",
        "* City names: Expected low variation (entropy ~0.5-1.0)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results Analysis\n",
        "* Exercise Benefits\n",
        "  - Moderate success rate (65%) with 13 successful responses out of 20 attempts\n",
        "  - High entropy across all fields (2.565, 2.458, 2.565)\n",
        "  - Consistent with previous pattern of high variation in descriptive content\n",
        "  - Shows detailed, well-formed responses for successful attempts\n",
        "  - All three benefits show similar levels of variation/uniqueness\n",
        "\n",
        "* Random Numbers\n",
        "  - Complete failure (0% success rate) with all 20 attempts failing\n",
        "  - All errors categorized as \"other_error\" suggesting systematic formatting issues\n",
        "  - Unable to analyze entropy or variation due to no successful responses\n",
        "  - Suggests need for improved prompt engineering for numerical responses\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cities\n",
        "  - Complete failure (0% success rate) with all 20 attempts failing\n",
        "  - All errors categorized as \"other_error\" like the numbers experiment\n",
        "  - Unable to analyze entropy or variation due to no successful responses\n",
        "  - Indicates potential issues with the model handling structured outputs for simpler tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Finding: The model shows better capability with complex descriptive tasks (exercise benefits) than with simpler structured tasks (numbers and cities), suggesting that the current prompt structure may need refinement for basic list-type responses. The exercise prompt's success indicates the model can handle structured output when properly guided."
