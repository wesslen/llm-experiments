How was your experience?Give us feedback.

1. 
Our overdraft fee for Consumer checking accounts is $35 per item (whether the overdraft is by check, ATM withdrawal, debit card transaction, or other electronic means), and we charge no more than three overdraft fees per business day. Overdraft fees are not applicable to Clear Access Banking accounts.

The payment of transactions into overdraft is discretionary and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is overdrawn or you have had excessive overdrafts. You must promptly bring your account to a positive balance.

2. 
With Extra Day Grace Period, if your account is overdrawn, you have an additional business day (extra day) to make covering deposits and/or transfers to avoid overdraft fees. If your available balance as of 11:59 pm Eastern Time on your extra day is positive, the pending overdraft fees for the prior business day’s overdraft items will be waived. If your available balance as of 11:59 pm Eastern Time is enough to cover some, but not all, of the prior business day’s overdraft items, the available balance will be applied to the transactions in the order that they posted to your account (based on our posting order practices described in the Deposit Account Agreement). Any overdraft items that are not covered by 11:59 pm Eastern Time on your extra day are subject to applicable overdraft fees. All deposits and transfers are subject to the Bank’s Availability of Funds Policy. Please see the Wells Fargo Deposit Account Agreement for more details.

3. 
Our standard overdraft coverage does not apply to Clear Access Banking accounts. Optional overdraft services, such as Overdraft Protection and Debit Card Overdraft Service, are not available for Clear Access Banking accounts. Other fees may apply, and it is possible for the account to have a negative balance. Please see the Wells Fargo Consumer Account Fee and Information Schedule and Deposit Account Agreement for details.

4. 
If you convert from a Wells Fargo account with check writing ability to a Clear Access Banking account, any outstanding check(s) presented on the new Clear Access Banking account on or after the date of conversion will be returned unpaid. The payee may charge additional fees when the check is returned. Make sure that any outstanding checks have been paid and/or you have made different arrangements with the payee(s) for the checks you have written before converting to the Clear Access Banking account.

5. 
With Early Pay Day, the Bank may make certain direct deposits available to you one to two business days before we receive the funds from the payor, which is typically your employer. Early Pay Day is not guaranteed, may vary between pay periods, and we may stop providing it at any time without advance notice to you. Our ability to provide early access to funds may be limited by many factors, such as when we receive notice of payment from your payor. It is always your obligation to verify that the funds are available in your account before spending them. Available for personal accounts only. See our Deposit Account Agreement for more details.

6. 
(A) If your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account is converted to another checking product or closed by us or you, all linked accounts are delinked from the Prime Checking or Premier Checking account and effective immediately, benefits no longer apply, including benefits to your now delinked accounts. You'll no longer receive discounts, options to avoid fees on other products or services, or the Relationship Interest Rate; for time accounts (CDs), this change will occur at renewal. Your delinked accounts will revert to the Bank's current applicable interest rate or fee at that time. (B) If you or we delink an account from your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account but other accounts remain linked, the loss of all benefits and the other consequences described above in (A) will immediately apply to the delinked account. Benefits available to your Prime Checking or Premier Checking account and any remaining linked accounts will continue.

7. 
Mobile deposit is only available through the Wells Fargo Mobile® app on eligible mobile devices. Deposit limits and other restrictions apply. Some accounts are not eligible for mobile deposit. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier's coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply. See Wells Fargo’s Online Access Agreement and your applicable business account fee disclosures for other terms, conditions, and limitations.

8. 
Digital wallets may not be available on all devices.

9. 
Enrollment with Zelle® through Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business Online® is required. Terms and conditions apply. To send or receive money with Zelle®, both parties must have an eligible checking or savings account. Transactions between enrolled users typically occur in minutes. For your protection, Zelle® should only be used for sending money to friends, family, or others you trust. Neither Wells Fargo nor Zelle® offers purchase protection for payments made with Zelle® - for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as described or as you expected. Payment requests to persons not already enrolled with Zelle® must be sent to an email address. For more information, view the Zelle® Transfer Service Addendum to the Wells Fargo Online Access Agreement. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply. Account fees (e.g., monthly service, overdraft, Small Business Account Analysis fees) may apply to Wells Fargo account(s) with which you use Zelle®.

10. 
Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply. Fargo is only available on the smartphone versions of the Wells Fargo Mobile® app.

11. 
You must be a Wells Fargo account holder of an eligible Wells Fargo consumer account with a FICO® Score available, and enrolled in Wells Fargo Online. Eligible Wells Fargo consumer accounts include deposit, loan, and credit accounts, but other consumer accounts may also be eligible. Contact Wells Fargo for details. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier's coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.

Please note that the score provided under this service is for educational purposes and may not be the score used by Wells Fargo to make credit decisions. Wells Fargo looks at many factors to determine your credit options; therefore, a specific FICO® Score or Wells Fargo credit rating does not guarantee a specific loan rate, approval of a loan, or an upgrade on a credit card.

Wells Fargo and Fair Isaac are not credit repair organizations as defined under federal and state law, including the Credit Repair Organizations Act. Wells Fargo and Fair Isaac don’t provide credit repair services or advice or assistance with rebuilding or improving your credit record, credit history, or credit rating.

12. 
Turning off your card is not a replacement for reporting your card lost or stolen. Contact us immediately if you believe that unauthorized transactions have been made. Turning your card off will not stop card transactions presented as recurring transactions or the posting of refunds, reversals, or credit adjustments to your account. Any digital card numbers linked to the card will also be turned off. For debit cards, turning off your card will not stop transactions using other cards linked to your deposit account. For credit cards, turning off your card will turn off all cards associated with your credit card account. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.

13. 
With Zero Liability protection, you will be reimbursed for promptly reported unauthorized card transactions, subject to certain conditions. Please see the applicable Wells Fargo account agreement or debit and ATM card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions.

14. 
Other fees may apply, and it is possible for the account to have a negative balance. Please see the Wells Fargo Consumer Account Fee and Information Schedule and Deposit Account Agreement for details.

1. 
When you have the Save As You Go transfer option, each time you (or any authorized signer or joint owner) use your debit card for a one-time purchase or complete a Bill Pay transaction through online banking, and the one-time debit card purchase or Bill Pay transaction posts to the account, we’ll automatically transfer $1 from your linked Wells Fargo checking account to your Way2Save Savings account. We may determine through our sole discretion if a particular transaction is a qualifying transaction. At the end of each business day, we count your qualifying transactions and multiply them by $1. Then we process that amount as a single transfer on the next business day. If your checking account does not have available funds, is overdrawn, or Overdraft Protection was initiated, the transfer won’t occur.

2. 
The fee period is the period used to calculate the monthly service fee. The fee period details are provided on the Monthly Service Fee Summary located in your account statement.

3. 
Overdraft Protection is not available for Clear Access Banking accounts.

4. 
The monthly service fee for Wells Fargo Fixed Rate CDs is $0. The minimum opening deposit for a Standard Fixed Rate CD is $2,500, unless otherwise noted. The minimum opening deposit is subject to change, as shown on wellsfargo.com/savings-cds/rates.

You may pay an early withdrawal penalty or a Regulation D penalty if you withdraw funds from your account before the term is complete. Some exceptions may apply. Penalties could reduce earnings on this account. The early withdrawal penalty amount is calculated and deducted from any earned interest. If the penalty is greater than the earned interest, the remaining penalty amount is deducted from the principal of the account.

The Regulation D penalty is seven days’ simple interest on the amount withdrawn and applies to:

 Withdrawals made within seven days of account opening including the day the account was opened.
 Withdrawals made during the grace period, when additional deposits are made during the grace period and the withdrawal exceeds the amount of the matured CD balance.
 Withdrawals within seven days of any prior withdrawal where the Bank’s early withdrawal penalty is not applied. 

Other than the Regulation D penalty described above, any money withdrawn from the CD before the end of its term will be subject to an early withdrawal penalty based on the length of the CD term. If your term is:

 Less than 90 days (or less than 3 months), the penalty is 1 month's interest,
 90 to 365 days (or 3-12 months), the penalty is 3 months' interest,
 Over 12 months through 24 months, the penalty is 6 months' interest, or
 Over 24 months, the penalty is 12 months' interest.

See the Consumer Account Fee and Information Schedule and Deposit Account Agreement for additional consumer account information.

5. 
Fees may reduce earnings. Interest rates are variable and may be changed by the Bank at any time.

Review routing instructions for receiving foreign currency wires

!Image 9

Foreign checks
--------------

Wells Fargo branches can accept checks issued in a limited number of foreign currencies and countries. Call or visit your local Wells Fargo branch to determine if your check is eligible for deposit.

Whether or not the wire transfer fee is waived, Wells Fargo makes money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when Wells Fargo converts one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees. The exchange rate Wells Fargo provides to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar. The applicable exchange rate may vary based on such factors including, but not limited to, currency pair, transaction size, payment channel and product type, such as foreign currency cash, checks, remittances, and wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. Wells Fargo is your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.

Incoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the “Applicable Exchange Rate” and “Incoming international wire transfer” sections of the Deposit Account Agreement.

Fees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above.

The first remittance sent under each service agreement must be completed in person at a Wells Fargo branch. Customers with an existing checking or savings account may be able to complete their first remittance by calling the Wells Fargo Phone Bank, subject to caller authentication requirements and additional fraud prevention controls. Additional remittances may be completed at a Wells Fargo branch, by calling the Wells Fargo Phone Bank, or through Wells Fargo Online® at wellsfargo.com. ExpressSend is not available on the Wells Fargo Mobile® app. Customers must use a desktop or laptop to conduct online ExpressSend transfers.

2.
The credit to account or the cash pick-up delivery methods for remittances may not be available at all Remittance Network Members or locations. When sending money to an account, we will need the beneficiary’s qualifying deposit account number at the Remittance Network Member. When sending money for cash pick up, the beneficiary's name provided by the sender must exactly match the beneficiary's name on their government issued identification.

Due to unanticipated conditions such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, system issues, currency availability, local regulatory requirements, required receiver action(s), and/or location-specific security concerns, cash pick-up remittances may not be available in certain Remittance Network Members (RNMs) and/or cities. If your beneficiary experiences any issues with the cash pick-up, contact us at 1-800-556-0605.

In addition to the transfer fee, Wells Fargo makes money when it converts one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate provided to you is set by Wells Fargo in its sole discretion, and it includes a markup. For additional information related to ExpressSend and foreign currency, please see the ExpressSend Terms and Conditions at wellsfargo.com/sendersrights.

Mobile and online banking when you need them
--------------------------------------------

Manage your money on the Wells Fargo Mobile® app when you’re on the go. And use Wells Fargo Online® when it’s more convenient to be on your computer.

1. 
Enrollment with Zelle® through Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business Online® is required. Terms and conditions apply. To send or receive money with Zelle®, both parties must have an eligible checking or savings account. Transactions between enrolled users typically occur in minutes. For your protection, Zelle® should only be used for sending money to friends, family, or others you trust. Neither Wells Fargo nor Zelle® offers purchase protection for payments made with Zelle® - for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as described or as you expected. Payment requests to persons not already enrolled with Zelle® must be sent to an email address. For more information, view the Zelle® Transfer Service Addendum to the Wells Fargo Online Access Agreement. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply. Account fees (e.g., monthly service, overdraft, Small Business Account Analysis fees) may apply to Wells Fargo account(s) with which you use Zelle®.

2. 
Terms and conditions apply. Setup is required for transfers to other U.S. financial institutions, and verification may take 1–3 business days. Customers should refer to their other U.S. financial institutions for information about any potential fees charged by those institutions. Mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply. See Wells Fargo’s Online Access Agreement for more information.

3. 
Digital wallets may not be available on all devices. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.

4. 
Digital wallet access is available at Wells Fargo ATMs and participating non-Wells Fargo ATMs for Wells Fargo Debit Cards in digital wallets. Message and data rates may apply. Some ATMs within secure locations may require a physical card for entry.

5. 
Enrollment in Digital Wires is subject to eligibility requirements, and terms and conditions apply. Applicable outgoing or incoming wire transfer service fees apply, unless waived by the terms of your account. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply. For more information, see the Wells Fargo Online Access Agreement and your applicable account fee disclosures for other terms, conditions, and limitations.

6. 
In addition to any applicable fees, Wells Fargo makes money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used is set by Wells Fargo, includes a markup and may be different than exchange rates you see elsewhere. For additional information related to Wires and foreign currency wires, please see the Online Access Agreement or applicable service documentation.

7. 
The first remittance sent under each service agreement must be completed in person at a Wells Fargo branch. Customers with an existing checking or savings account may be able to complete their first remittance by calling the Wells Fargo Phone Bank, subject to caller authentication requirements and additional fraud prevention controls. Additional remittances may be completed at a Wells Fargo branch, by calling the Wells Fargo Phone Bank, or through Wells Fargo Online® at wellsfargo.com. ExpressSend is not available on the Wells Fargo Mobile® app. Customers must use a desktop or laptop to conduct online ExpressSend transfers.

8. 
Due to unanticipated conditions such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, system issues, currency availability, local regulatory requirements, required receiver action(s), and/or location-specific security concerns, cash pick-up remittances may not be available in certain Remittance Network Members (RNMs) and/or cities. If your beneficiary experiences any issues with the cash pick-up, contact us at 1-800-556-0605.

9. 
The credit to account or the cash pick-up delivery methods for remittances may not be available at all Remittance Network Members or locations. When sending money to an account, we will need the beneficiary’s qualifying deposit account number at the Remittance Network Member. When sending money for cash pick up, the beneficiary's name provided by the sender must exactly match the beneficiary's name on their government issued identification.

10. 
Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply. Fargo is only available on the smartphone versions of the Wells Fargo Mobile® app.

Card controls | Wells Fargo

===============

Skip to content

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take control of how your digital and physical Wells Fargo cards are used.

 Turn your card on or off Footnote 1 1 to restrict purchases or potential misuse
 Manage debit card usage outside of the United States
 View card details including balances, linked accounts, and daily limits

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Keep track of merchants you've had recurring transactions with in the past year
 Avoid service disruptions by updating merchants with your current card information
 Your recurring payments list is for informational purposes and may not include all of your recurring payments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Card controls help you keep track of the digital wallets linked to your account and the devices they’re active on. If you ever misplace your device, use card controls to temporarily suspend your digital card number and prevent the wallet from completing any new transactions.

1.
Turning off your card is not a replacement for reporting your card lost or stolen. Contact us immediately if you believe that unauthorized transactions have been made. Turning your card off will not stop card transactions presented as recurring transactions or the posting of refunds, reversals, or credit adjustments to your account. Any digital card numbers linked to the card will also be turned off. For debit cards, turning off your card will not stop transactions using other cards linked to your deposit account. For credit cards, turning off your card will turn off all cards associated with your credit card account. Availability may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.

2.
Digital wallets may not be available on all devices. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.

Common mortgage questions
-------------------------

How much home can I afford?

Many people start by determining what they can afford as a monthly payment. A common starting point is to calculate 25% of your gross monthly income to help determine a manageable monthly mortgage payment.

What parts of my finances does a mortgage lender review?

A lender will check your credit score and history, your debt-to-income ratio, which is a measurement of the amount of debt you have compared to your income, and take a general look at how much money you have in checking and savings accounts in order to be confident you’ll be able to pay for your mortgage, taxes, and other costs associated with buying a home.

What is the minimum down payment for conventional, FHA, and VA loans?

Wells Fargo offers several low down payment options, including conventional loans (those not backed by a government agency).

Conventional fixed-rate loans are available with a down payment as low as 3%.Opens a modal dialog for footnote 6

 Talk with a home mortgage consultant about loan amount, loan type, property type, income, first-time homebuyer, and homebuyer education requirements to discuss eligibility.

FHA loans are available with as little as 3.5% down.

 FHA loans have the benefit of a low down payment, but consider all costs involved, including up-front and long-term mortgage insurance and all fees. Ask your home mortgage consultant to help you compare the overall costs of all your home financing options.

VA loans Up to 100% financing may be available on VA loans for qualified borrowers.Opens a modal dialog for footnote 7

What other costs are part of my mortgage?

Your monthly mortgage payment typically will include principal and interest on the mortgage, as well as homeowners insurance and property taxes if your mortgage payment includes escrow. Depending on your down payment and loan type, you may also have to pay private mortgage insurance as part of your monthly mortgage payment.

If you extend your loan term, you may pay more interest over the life of your loan.

If you are a service member on active duty, an eligible spouse, partner, or dependent, or currently receiving SCRA benefits, please consult with your legal advisor prior to seeking a refinance of your existing mortgage loan. In some cases, a refinance may impact your eligibility for benefits under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act or applicable state law.

1. Powered by ComeHome.

2. 
Using a cash-out refinance to consolidate debt increases your mortgage debt, reduces equity, and extends the term on shorter-term debt and secures such debts with your home. The relative benefits you receive from debt consolidation will vary depending on your individual circumstances. You should consider that debt consolidation may increase the total number of monthly payments and the total amount paid over the term of the loan. To enjoy the benefits of debt consolidation, you should not carry new credit card or high interest rate debt.

3. 
The Homebuyer Access® grant may help customers purchase a home by providing a $10,000 grant for a down payment, subject to eligibility requirements. Grant funds cannot be used in connection with the financing of a Wells Fargo real estate owned (REO) property purchase. Repayment is not required for the grant. To use the grant, the full $10,000 must be applied toward the down payment. We cannot apply less than the full amount. The down payment grant is available in certain areas. Eligibility for grant money will not be confirmed until underwriting is complete.

Eligibility requirements:

Loan type: The grant may be used with a Wells Fargo fixed-rate conventional loan only. Loan types, such as non-conforming loans, government loans, and conventional adjustable-rate mortgages, are not eligible.

Income: The total qualifying income of all borrowers must be less than or equal to 120% of the area median income in the county where the subject property is located.

Location: The borrower's verified current permanent residential address must be located in an eligible area or the subject property the borrower is purchasing must be located in an eligible area.

Occupancy: The borrower must occupy the subject property they are purchasing as their primary residence.

Contact a home mortgage consultant to discuss eligibility requirements.

Possible tax implications: Accepting and using grant funds may be considered additional taxable income and will be reported on Form 1099-MISC for the primary borrower (the first person listed on the loan) on the application. This means the borrower may owe taxes on that additional income. The grant funds received may also affect any eligibility for income based assistance, such as government programs like student loan payment relief or other government payments that may be based on income. Before accepting this grant, customers should consider speaking with a tax advisor to understand if their taxes may be affected by this grant.

4. 
The Dream. Plan. Home.® closing cost credit may help eligible consumers purchasing their primary residence. The closing cost credit is designed for consumers with income at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI) of the property location. The closing cost credit is available in certain areas and is not available with all loan types. Please speak with a home mortgage consultant for details.

5. 
Discount not eligible with FHA and VA loans.

6. 
With a low down payment, mortgage insurance will be required, which increases the cost of the loan and will increase the monthly payment.

7. 
Customers must meet all eligibility requirements for the VA program. Please discuss current VA eligibility requirements with a home mortgage consultant.

Personal Loan FAQs

What's a personal loan?

It's a way to borrow money to pay for just about anything you need, like home improvements, debt consolidationOpens a modal dialog for footnote 2, major purchases, and more. Personal loans are unsecured, which means there's no collateral, like the equity you own in your car or house. You receive funds in one lump sum and pay the loan back in fixed monthly payments, with interest calculated into the repayments. Wells Fargo offers loans from $3,000 to $100,000 with terms of 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months.Opens a modal dialog for footnote 4

How do I get a personal loan?
With Wells Fargo, the whole process is hassle free. First, you take a moment to check your personalized rate and payment options with no impact on your credit score. Then, choose the option that's right for your budget and complete the easy application online, by phone, or by going into a Wells Fargo branch and applying in person with a personal banker.

What's the interest rate on a personal loan?
Your interest rate for a Wells Fargo personal loan is an annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is calculated based on a number of factors, including your loan amount, term, and credit history. When you check your loan options for a specific loan amount, you can see the rate.

How fast is the personal loan process?
It's all streamlined, every step of the way. First, checking your rate takes only a few minutes. From there, once you select the loan you want to move forward with, the application takes just a few minutes. Then, most customers get a same-day decision. Once you're approved, you could receive funds as soon as the same day you sign for your loan.Opens a modal dialog for footnote 7

What do I need to get a personal loan?
To be eligible to apply, you need to be a Wells Fargo customer for at least 12 months and meet other applicant requirements. To complete your application, you'll need to provide certain documents and information regarding your employment, income, and other qualifications. You can find everything required on our handy Application Checklist. Finally, after you accept your loan terms, you'll need to provide your signature and a few other details.

Will my credit be impacted when I apply for a personal loan?
Checking your loan options, including your rates and terms, will not affect your credit score. Please note that once you make a selection and submit an application, there will be a full credit report requested from at least one credit bureau. This is considered a hard credit pull and can impact your credit score.

Checking your rate uses a soft credit inquiry, which does not affect your credit score. If you submit an application, it will result in a hard credit inquiry that may affect your credit score.

1. 
At least 10% of the applicants approved for these terms qualified for the lowest rate available based on data from 04/01/2025 to 06/30/2025. The rates shown are as of 07/07/2025 and subject to change without notice. Your Annual Percentage Rate (APR) will be based on the amount of credit requested, loan term and your creditworthiness. The lowest rate available assumes excellent credit history.

2. 
Before you apply, we encourage you to carefully consider whether consolidating your existing debt is the right choice for you. Consolidating multiple debts means you will have a single payment monthly, but it may not reduce or pay your debt off sooner. The payment reduction may come from a lower interest rate, a longer loan term, or a combination of both. By extending the loan term, you may pay more in interest over the life of the loan. By understanding how consolidating your debt benefits you, you will be in a better position to decide if it is the right option for you. New credit accounts are subject to application, credit qualification, and income verification.

3. 
To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you must have a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult with a Wells Fargo banker or consult our FAQs. If automatic payments are canceled, for any reason at any time, after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. Only one relationship discount may be applied per application.

4. 
Representative example of repayment terms for an unsecured personal loan: For $16,000 borrowed over 36 months at 12.99% Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the monthly payment is $539. This example is an estimate only and assumes all payments are made on time.

5. 
Late fees may still be assessed.

6. 
Annual Percentage Rate will be based on credit history, the amount financed, and the loan term.

7. 
On average, 97% of customers received their funds the day they signed for their personal loan. (Based on data from April – June 2025).

1. Allocations may vary slightly if the Sustainability Focused portfolio is selected. An investment's social policy could cause it to forgo opportunities to gain exposure to certain industries, companies, sectors or regions of the economy, which could cause it to underperform similar investments that do not operate under a social policy. There are many factors to take into consideration when choosing an investment portfolio and ESG data is only one component to potentially consider.

2. The Intuitive Investor program is not designed for excessively traded or inactive accounts and is not appropriate for all investors. Please carefully review the Wells Fargo Advisors advisory disclosure document for a full description of our services. The minimum account size for this program is $500.

3. There are also management fees and other expenses associated with the funds in your portfolio (as explained in each fund’s prospectus in the fees and expense section).

4. When you link your Intuitive Investor account offered through Wells Fargo Advisors to your Wells Fargo Bank Prime Checking, Premier Checking or Private Bank Interest Checking account, you will receive a discount on your Intuitive Investor account advisory fee. The advisory fee discount will be based on the type of checking account you have and will be applied at account opening if the account is eligible to be linked to an existing Wells Fargo Bank Prime Checking, Premier Checking or Private Bank Interest Checking account. If your Intuitive Investor account is not linked to a Wells Fargo Bank Prime Checking, Premier Checking or Private Bank Interest Checking account within 90 days, the discounted advisory fee will no longer apply and the standard advisory fee of 0.35% will apply. If the Wells Fargo Bank Prime Checking, Premier Checking or Private Bank Interest Checking account is closed, the discounted advisory fee will discontinue and revert to the standard advisory fee of 0.35%. Custodial accounts and certain trust accounts are not eligible for the Wells Fargo Bank Prime Checking, Premier Checking or Private Bank Interest Checking account advisory fee discount.
